<h2>Program overview</h2>
<p>The Wubuy Frequency Finder is a simple program which reads in formatted Wubuy texts and produces an output describing the phonotactic environments found at word boundaries. This output is split into 3 different files of increasing complexity. The first, <em>output.txt</em>, provides a summery of the different target environments, tallying paused and unpaused word boundaries separately. The second file, <em>output_long.txt</em>, provides the same information as the summery, with the addition of each exact phonological environments that were found. The final file, <em>word_environments.txt</em>, takes this a step further and provides a list of the words that created the environments in order of appearance.</p>
<p>The program ignores both morphological boundaries present in the input for the purposes of looking for sound environments, though these boundaries are preserved in the provided word-list. For further information on how the program handles input see the section on Formatting below.</p>
<h3>Running the program</h3>
<p>In order to run the program you must first open a terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>python3 &lt;path_to_file&gt;/Frequency_Finder.py &lt;input_file&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If no input file is specified, the file <em>test data.txt</em> will be used.</p>
<p>NOTE: This program requires at least python 3.9, if unsure of which version you currently have run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>python3 –version</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Input Formatting</h2>
<p>The program assumes that the input file has no headings and each line starts with marking for paragraph and line as well as a page number of the source in the following format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;paragraph&gt;.&lt;line&gt; &lt;page_number&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally the program only currently supports text files that only contains the Wubuy language examples.</p>
<h3>Special characters</h3>
<p>The program automatically ignores the following characters when finding phonetic environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>* 				- notes in original text</li>
<li>Ø					- zero morpheme</li>
<li>“					- quotation</li>
<li>’					- obscured phoneme(s)</li>
<li>&gt;					-“completion of word” (from Heath 1980 pg. 13)</li>
</ul>
<p>These characters will still be present in the outputted word-list.</p>
<p>Words surrounded by &lt;zigzag&gt;…&lt;/zigzag&gt;, representing uncertain transcriptions, are counted by the program.</p>
<h3>Pauses</h3>
<p>The following characters will create a paused environment between words.</p>
<ul>
<li>.</li>
<li>,</li>
<li>!</li>
</ul>
<h3>‘Illegal’ words</h3>
<p>The following markings will mark a word as invalid for analysis, preventing any targets being found involving them</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;und&gt;…&lt;/und&gt; 	- non native words</li>
<li>xxx 				- unintelligible</li>
<li>(…)				- annotations</li>
<li>–					- interruption in text</li>
</ul>
<h2>Log files</h2>
<p>Each time the program is run it will produce a log file, named for the time of program execution. This provides a breakdown of each word found by the program, as well as the matches found. However they are primarily for the purposes of finding errors, and can safely be ignored.</p>
